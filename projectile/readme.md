# Projectile Motion

Projectile is a particle that has being given an initial velocity and then moves freely under gravity.

**Range:** The range of a projectile is the horizontal distance covered by the partile from the point of launching to the ground.

### Formula for finding projectile range
Range = 2*U*sin(theta)/g
where **U**=Initial Velocity, **g**=acceleration due to gravity **theta**=angle of projection
